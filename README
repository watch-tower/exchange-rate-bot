As pointed in the task, USD should be used as base currency but free subscription plan allows only use EUR as one

The bot supports three commands
Arguments to the commands are passed together with the command in one row

1. /list
    It makes request to exchange rate service https://exchangeratesapi.io/v1/latest?access_key=key&base=EUR
    When data is received, it checks for if response is success
    Next, bot caches the data
    Update interval is specified in file config.py

2. /exchange amount CURRENCY
    Exchanges from the first currency(EUR) into the second one
    exchange endpoints are not free of the service, so I exchanged it alone
    ex. /exchange 10 UAH (will produce 10 * UAH rate)

3. /history CURRENCY
   Creates bar chart showing exchange rate between base currency(EUR) and CURRENCY
   Bot uses API https://quickchart.io/ to draw a bar chart


I could not create popup window to show error messages


To run the bot do the following steps:
   1. get access_token on exchangeratesapi.io 
   2. get bot_token from telegram bot father
   3. write the tokens into config.py
   4. python3 -m venv venv
   5. source venv/bin/activate
   6. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   7. python3 bot.py

Go to telegram and send the commands to the bot
